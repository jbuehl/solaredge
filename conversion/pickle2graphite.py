"""
Send SolarEdge performance metrics to Graphite via the graphite/carbon pickle listener port.

graphite will accept batches of metrics (in a pickled nested list of tuples format) over a pickle listener port (usually
2004) as well as individual metric values, one at a time, over the (usually) 2003 port.

The `Pickle2Graphite` class converts a nested dictionary (such as produced by `json.loads` on some solaredge traffic
that has been processed by semonitor) into the nested list of tuples structure expected by carbon.  The `send` method
pickles it, adds the requisite header, and sends it to graphite.

You may need to adjust the delay parameter, depending upon the capacity and busyness of the graphite server.  I have
found 0.2 works fine **for me** in production mode, when I am "following" some existing metrics in real time, as the
solaredge inverter emits them, but I needed to increase it to as much as 5.0 the first time I sent a new batch of metrics
to graphite, otherwise the carbon listener seemed to be swamped and didn't have time to create all the new metrics.
To be completely precise, I had problems when I sent an existing batch of metrics to a new "test"  base, which meant
graphite / carbon had to create a whole lot of new whisper files all at once.
